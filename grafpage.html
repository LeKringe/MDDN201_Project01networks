  <h2 style="text-align:center;">
  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graffiti">Graffiti</a> is a form of writings or drawings made on a wall or surface, normally as a form of illegal artistic expression. However, there exist graffiti done for work purposes, especially related to the internet network maintenance. As various network components are installed underground out of public view, graffiti is sometimes used as a marker to let workers know which component is where, as it can be difficult to find without any other markers. What they normally do is spray paint symbols and/or words on the ground, where the network component is situated. Due to a lack of proper documentation on what these symbols mean, it can be difficult to decipher their true meaning or purpose, other than the fact that it is an actual legal piece of graffiti.</p>

  <p>In this marking we can see that it seems to point out a position of an entry point that leads to a gas pipe. Through this workers can access the rest of the network of gas lines underneath the city. This also allows for easier maintenance and access. </p>

	  	 <h3 style="text-align:center;">
  <p>These arrows are probably an indicator for which direction a pipeline is directed at, and at which direction it's contents are flowing towards. This helps to save time when doing maintenance and repair, or when following the direction of the pipeflow among the large network of pipelines underground.</p>

  	<div>

  <p>This seems to be a sort of directory that lists out the names of the components in the area. Again, this makes looking for the right component much easier and less time consuming, as well as acting as a guide as to what component is in the area.</p>
